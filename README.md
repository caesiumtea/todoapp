# To-Do App (Udacity FSND)
This is my implementation of the to-do list project from Course 1 of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. The majority of the code was written by following along with the instructor rather than being original work. It's a simple app that allows a user to create a to-do list, mark items as complete, and delete them, with a barebones user interface.
